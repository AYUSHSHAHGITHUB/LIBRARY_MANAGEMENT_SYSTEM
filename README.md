# Library Management System (LMS) - Python

# Overview

The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a Python-based application designed to manage the operations of a library. It allows users to:
- Manage books (add, update, delete).
- Register and manage library members.
- Track book issues and returns.
- Calculate and manage overdue fines.
- Search and filter books by title, author, or availability.

This project is aimed at simplifying the management of library resources and streamlining the borrowing and returning process for both members and librarians.

# Features

- **Book Management**: Add, update, or delete books.
- **Member Management**: Add and remove library members.
- **Issue and Return System**: Issue books to members and track return dates.
- **Overdue Fines**: Calculate fines for overdue books.
- **Search and Filter**: Search books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Reports**: Generate reports on overdue books and borrowed books.

# Requirements

- **Python 3.x** or higher.
- No external libraries are required for the basic system, but you can extend it with libraries like `Tkinter` for a GUI or `SQLite` for database storage.

# Setup Instructions

# 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/AYUSHSHAHGITHUB/LIBRARY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.git]
cd library-management-system

# 2. Install Dependencies

This project doesn’t have external dependencies by default. If you wish to extend the system (e.g., using a database), you might need to install additional packages like `sqlite3` or `Tkinter` for the GUI.

To install optional dependencies (like SQLite or Tkinter):

pip install sqlite3  # If you're using SQLite
pip install tk       # If you want a Tkinter GUI

### 3. Running the System

To run the library management system:

python library_management_system.py

The system will prompt you with different options to interact with the library's books and members, including adding books, issuing books, returning them, and searching for books.

## File Structure

```plaintext
library-management-system/
│
├── library_management_system.py  # Main Python file containing the system logic
├── books.csv                     # (Optional) CSV file to store book data
├── members.csv                   # (Optional) CSV file to store member data
└── README.md                     # This file


# Example Usage

# Adding Books:

1. Add Book

The system will prompt you to enter details like book ID, title, author, and ISBN. You can add multiple books in this way.

# Borrowing Books:

2. Borrow Book

To borrow a book, enter the book ID and your member ID. The system will issue the book and track the due date.

# Returning Books:

3. Return Book

Enter the book ID and your member ID. If the book is returned late, the system will calculate and apply a fine.

# EXTENDING THGE SYSTEM

# 1. Add Database Support:

For larger systems, you might want to store data in a database rather than files. You can integrate SQLite or MySQL by modifying the file handling code and replacing it with database queries.

# 2. GUI Interface:

This system uses a simple command-line interface. You can enhance it by creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like `Tkinter`.

# 3. Authentication:

Implement login functionality for both library staff and users with different roles and permissions.

# Additional Notes:

- This system can be extended with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using libraries such as **Tkinter** or **PyQt**.
- **Database support** can be added to replace file-based storage for a more robust and scalable system.
